Description: Feature hashing, also called as the hashing trick, is a method to 
  transform features to vector. Without looking up the indices in an 
  associative array, it applies a hash function to the features and uses their 
  hash values as indices directly. The method of feature hashing in this package
  was proposed in Weinberger et. al. (2009). The hashing algorithm is the murmurhash3 
  from the digest package. Please see the README.md for more information.
